## Research interests

My research interests span complex system analysis in biological systems using network theory, statistical analysis and mathematical models. 

I joined the Lab in December 2019 in the fascinating project [PREGO](https://evangelospafilis.github.io/prego_web_site/) which aims to link microbial processes to ecosystem function.
