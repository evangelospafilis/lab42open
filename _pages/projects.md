**PREGO:** Process, environment, organism (PREGO) is a systems-biology approach to elucidate ecosystem function at the microbial dimension. Find out more at <http://prego.hcmr.gr/>

**ELIXIR-GR:** [ELIXIR-GR](https://www.elixir-greece.org/) is the Greek National Node of the ESFRI European RI ELIXIR, a distributed e-Infrastructure aiming at the construction of a sustainable European infrastructure for biological information. Follow the links to find out more about the [Marine Omics pilot action](https://www.elixir-greece.org/node/86#marine) and the [LifeWatchGreece MicroCT vLab](https://www.elixir-greece.org/node/78) the team relates to.


**PEMA:** [PEMA](http://pema.hcmr.gr/) is a containerized assembly of key metabarcoding analysis tools supporting the complete bioinformatics analysis of a series of marker genes (16S/18S rRNA, COI and ITS). PEMA's time-efficient performance and quality results will allows for accurate environmental DNA metabarcoding analysis enhancing the applicability of next-generation biodiversity assessment studies. [PEMA documentation site](https://hariszaf.github.io/pema_documentation/) is now available.
