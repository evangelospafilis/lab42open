## Research interests

My research focuses on text mining of large corpora, for [organism](http://organisms.hcmr.gr), process, [environment](http://environments.hcmr.gr) and other [biological entity mentions](http://reflect.ws).
The aim is to [extract](http://extract.hcmr.gr) knowledge and propose innovative hypotheses. This is in relevance to a broad sprectrum of biological application ranging from biomedicine to molecular ecology and biodiversity. <br>

At the mean time I enjoy co-coordinating the Institute of Marine Biology Biotechnology and Aquaculture's [High Performance Computing](http://hpc.hcmr.gr) facility, organizing citizen-science [sampling and analysing soil samples around Crete](http://wiki.gensc.org/index.php?title=GSC_island_sampling_day), and [taking pictures](http://epafilis/info/photography). <br>
