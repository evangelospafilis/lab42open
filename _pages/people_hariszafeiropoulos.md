## Short profile
I am a PhD student at [IMBBC-HCMR](http://imbbc3.hcmr.gr/) working on ecological networks and microbial ecology by exploring how techniques such as knowledge aggregation and data integration could serve these fields. 

My interests mostly focus on inferring microbial interactions that would allow the building of ecological networks with respect to microbial communities. 

I joined \<lab42/\> OPEN on 2017 and it was during my MSc thesis when I implemented [PEMA](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema).

I am now a member of the [PREGO](https://evangelospafilis.github.io/prego_web_site/) team as well as of the [ELIXIR-GR](https://www.elixir-greece.org/). 


## Brief CV

## Additional Projects

**ELIXIR-GR:** [ELIXIR-GR](https://www.elixir-greece.org/) is the Greek National Node of the [ESFRI European RI ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/). Its goal is to bring together Europe’s laboratories and data centres to help coordinate the collection, quality control and storage of large amounts of biological data produced by life science experiments. ELIXIR-GR has recently secured funding from EU Structural and Investment Funds for supporting a number of selected Research Infrastructures of the Greek National Roadmap.

**RECONNECT:** Interreg V-B "Balkan-Mediterranean 2014-2020" project (MIS: 5017160). [RECONNECT]( https://reconnect.hcmr.gr/) aims to develop strategies for sustainable management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and Natura 2000 sites.

**JERICO-NEXT:** a Horizon 2020 project. Among other objectives, [JERICO-NEXT](http://www.jerico-ri.eu/ )  aims to monitor changes in macrobenthic biodiversity so as to assess environmental disturbances 	(e.g. eutrophication, fishing, river input), potential controls and the pertinent functional 	consequences.
