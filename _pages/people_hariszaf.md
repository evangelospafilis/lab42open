## Short profile
I am a PhD student at IMBBC-HCMR working on ecological networks and microbial ecology by exploring how techniques such as knowledge aggregation and data integration could serve these fields. 

My interests mostly focus on inferring microbial interactions that would allow the building of ecological networks with respect to microbial communities. 

I joined \<lab42\/\> OPEN on 2017 and it was during my MSc thesis when I implemented [PEMA](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema)

I am now a member of the PREGO team as well as of the ELIXIR-GR.

## Publications 
- PEMA: from the raw .fastq files of 16S rRNA and COI marker genes to the (M)OTU-table, a thorough metabarcoding analysis Haris Zafeiropoulos, Ha Quoc Viet, Katerina Vasileiadou, Antonis Potirakis, Christos Arvanitidis, Pantelis Topalis, Christina Pavloudi, Evangelos Pafilis bioRxiv 709113; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/709113  (preprint)


## Projects
**PREGO:** Process, environment, organism (PREGO) is a systems-biology approach to elucidate ecosystem function at the microbial dimension. 

**ELIXIR – GR:** [ELIXIR-GR](https://www.elixir-greece.org/) is the Greek National Node of the ESFRI European RI ELIXIR, a distributed e-Infrastructure aiming at the construction of a sustainable European infrastructure for biological information. 

**RECONNECT:** Interreg V-B "Balkan-Mediterranean 2014-2020" project (MIS: 5017160) - https://reconnect.hcmr.gr/ .RECONNECT aims to develop strategies for sustainable management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and Natura 2000 sites.

**JERICO-NEXT:** a Horizon 2020 project. Among other objectives, [JERICO-NEXT](http://www.jerico-ri.eu/ )  aims to monitor changes in macrobenthic biodiversity so as to assess environmental disturbances 	(e.g. eutrophication, fishing, river input), potential controls and the pertinent functional 	consequences.
